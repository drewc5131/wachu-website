                    <p>Wachusett Regional High School encourages students to take part in the wealth of activities that exist at our school outside the classroom. The clubs and activities listed through the links below will appeal to a wide range of interests. Most of the clubs listed below will run during the school year, but some are entirely dependent on the interests of students.</p>
                    <p>If a student wishes to form a new club, the student must <a class="link" href="http://www.wrsd.net/wrhs/documents/General/ClubApplication.pdf"><strong>download the Application to Form a Club</strong></a>, fill it out and bring it to the main office.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fundraising Activities</strong>: Before any student group can raise money for their activities, the adult adviser must fill out and submit a <a class="link" href="http://www.wrsd.net/wrhs/documents/General/FundraisingApplication.pdf"><strong>Fundraising Application Form</strong></a>. That form must be submitted to the principal at least two weeks before any fundraising event.</p>

                    <h1 class="header">2016-2017</h1>
                    <p>Below is a compilation of clubs and athletic teams  at Wachusett Regional High School. Although many of the clubs listed will run, some are entirely dependent on the interests of the student body. In addition, new clubs are formed almost every year.  The requirement for forming a new club is to get the permission of the Principal and secure an advisor for the club who must also be approved by the Principal.</p>
                    <p>Members may post flyers around the building announcing meetings or information can be broadcast over the school’s public address system during each day’s morning announcements by filing a written announcement and getting the advisor’s permission for the announcement to be read. All announcements read over the PA in the morning are also posted on the <a class="link" href="index.html">school’s website</a>. Forms for morning announcements are available in the Main office.  Completed forms may be left there for the approval of the Principal.</p>

                        <strong>Wachusett Feminists (kill me) </strong>(Ms. Martin)<br>
                        Feminism is a positive and essential driver of change in today’s society. As a club, our goal will be to educate Wachusett as to what feminism truly is. Fundraising will be another priority as we seek to encourage other feminists and those less fortunate. The ability to organize and share our thoughts as a student body is a great gift that we want to take full advantage of in spreading a message we feel is extremely important in creating our future.
